This repository demonstrates an example of an unhandled error in an asynchronous Express.js route handler.  The bug is caused by an error thrown within a `setTimeout` callback without proper error handling. The solution showcases how to use a `try...catch` block to handle the error gracefully and prevent the application from crashing.  The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code.
